4 long skewers
1 tablespoon butter
1 clove garlic, minced
1 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped
2 teaspoons paprika
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 cup heavy cream
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro

Instructions:

Biryani:
Make few slits on all the chicken pieces and add to a large bowl
Mix everything well and marinate the chicken.Cover and set this aside for 1 hour
Add 2 cups of basmati rice to a large pot and rinse it at least thrice.Drain and soak in fresh water for 30 minutes.Drain to a colander after 30 mins.
Heat ghee or oil in a heavy bottom pit or pressure cooker.Make sure you use a large one for this.Using whole spice is optional but recommended.Use whatever you have.
Add thinly sliced onions.On a medium heat, fry them stirring often until uniformly light brown.
Add marinated chicken & saute until it becomes pale for 5 minutes.
Lower the flame completely.Cover and cook until the chicken is soft, tender and completly cooked.
Check if the chicken is cooked by pricking with a fork or knife.It has to be just cooked and not overdone.Evaporate any excess moisture left in the pot by cooking further without the lid.
Taste test and add more salt if needed.I added 1/4 more salt here.
Mix everything well.Spread it evenly in a single layer.
Layer drained rice all over the chicken.To a separate pot, pour 3 cups water and add 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt.If cooking in a pot, start with 3 cups water at this stage.Stir and taste the water.It must be slightly salty.Bring the water to a rolling boil.Pour 2 cups of this hot water across the sides of the cooker or pot.Pour rest of the water over the rice gently.
Level the rice gently on top.Add 2 tablespoons more mint leaves.Do not mix up everything, the taste of the biryani cooked in the shown method is good.
Finally cover the pot or cooker.If cooking in a pot, cook on a medium heat until the rice is cooked completely.If the rice is undercooked and there is no more water left at the bottom of the pot, pour 1/4 to 1/2 cup boiling water at this stage.How much water to add depends on the quality of basmati rice.Cook covered until the biryani rice is perfectly done, grainy and fully cooked.Rest it covered for 15 mins.If cooking in a cooker, cook until you hear 1 whistle.Later remove the cooker form the hot burner to stop cooking further.
When the pressure releases naturally, open the lid.Gently fluff up with a fork.
Serve chicken biryani in layers-top layer with rice and bottom layer with chicken.Enjoy with raita or shorba.

Butter Chicken:
In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; let marinate for 30 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time allows).
Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in batches of two or three, making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm. (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)
Heat butter or ghee in the same pan. Fry the onions until they start to sweat (about 6 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan.
Add garlic and ginger and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant, then add ground coriander, cumin and garam masala. Let cook for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.
Add crushed tomatoes, chili powder and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.
Remove from heat, scoop mixture into a blender and blend until smooth. You may need to add a couple tablespoons of water to help it blend (up to 1/4 cup). Work in batches depending on the size of your blender.
Pour the puréed sauce back into the pan. Stir the cream, sugar and crushed kasoori methi (or fenugreek leaves) through the sauce. Add the chicken with juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling.
Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve with fresh, hot garlic butter rice and fresh homemade Naan bread!

Chicken Tikka Masala:
Combine yogurt, lemon juice, 2 teaspoons cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, black pepper, ginger, and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl.
Stir in chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Preheat a grill for high heat.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Thread chicken onto skewers, and discard marinade.
Grill until juices run clear, about 5 minutes on each side.
Melt butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Sauté garlic and jalapeño for 1 minute. Season with remaining 2 teaspoons cumin, paprika, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Stir in tomato sauce and cream. Simmer on low heat until sauce thickens, about 20 minutes.
Add grilled chicken, and simmer for 10 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter, and garnish with fresh cilantro.
Serve over rice.
