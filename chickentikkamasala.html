    <h2>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken Tikka Masala is a beloved and iconic dish that originates from the vibrant culinary tapestry of Indian cuisine. Succulent pieces of marinated chicken are first grilled or roasted to 
achieve a smoky tenderness, creating a foundation of flavor. These morsels are then enveloped in a rich and creamy tomato-based sauce that is artfully infused with a medley of aromatic spices like 
cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. The dish strikes a harmonious balance between the mild heat of the spices and the soothing creaminess of the sauce, resulting in a deeply satisfying and tantalizing experience for the palate. Whether enjoyed with fragrant basmati rice or freshly baked naan bread, Chicken 
Tikka Masala stands as a testament to the culinary artistry that transforms simple ingredients into a symphony of taste and texture, delighting taste buds around the world. </p>
