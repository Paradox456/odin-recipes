     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic South Asian dish that combines fragrant long-grain 
rice with tender pieces of meat, vegetables, or both. It is known for its rich blend of spices 
and herbs, creating a symphony of flavors that tantalize the taste buds. Biryani's origins can 
be traced back to the Indian subcontinent, where it has evolved into various regional 
variations, each with its own unique twist. </p>

   <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
	<li>Make few slits on all the chicken pieces and add to a large bowl</li>
	<li>Mix everything well and marinate the chicken.Cover and set this aside for 1 
hour</li>
	<li>Add 2 cups of basmati rice to a large pot and rinse it at least thrice.Drain and 
soak in fresh water for 30 minutes.Drain to a colander after 30 mins.</li>
	<li>Heat ghee or oil in a heavy bottom pit or pressure cooker.Make sure you use a large 
one for this.Using whole spice is optional but recommended.Use whatever you have.</li>
	<li>Add thinly sliced onions.On a medium heat, fry them stirring often until uniformly 
light brown.</li>
	<li>Add marinated chicken & saute until it becomes pale for 5 minutes.</li>
	<li>Lower the flame completely.Cover and cook until the chicken is soft, tender and 
completly cooked.</li>
	<li>Check if the chicken is cooked by pricking with a fork or knife.It has to be just 
cooked and not overdone.Evaporate any excess moisture left in the pot by cooking further without 
the lid.</li>
	<li> Taste test and add more salt if needed.I added 1/4 more salt here.</li>
	<li>Mix everything well.Spread it evenly in a single layer.</li>
	<li>Layer drained rice all over the chicken.To a separate pot, pour 3 cups water and add 
1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt.If cooking in a pot, start with 3 cups water at this stage.Stir and 
taste the water.It must be slightly salty.Bring the water to a rolling boil.Pour 2 cups of this 
hot water across the sides of the cooker or pot.Pour rest of the water over the rice gently.   
</li>
	<li>Level the rice gently on top.Add 2 tablespoons more mint leaves.Do not mix up 
everything, the taste of the biryani cooked in the shown method is good.</li>
	<li>Finally cover the pot or cooker.If cooking in a pot, cook on a medium heat until the 
rice is cooked completely.If the rice is undercooked and there is no more water left at the 
bottom of the pot, pour 1/4 to 1/2 cup boiling water at this stage.How much water to add depends 
on the quality of basmati rice.Cook covered until the biryani rice is perfectly done, grainy and 
fully cooked.Rest it covered for 15 mins.If cooking in a cooker, cook until you hear 1 
whistle.Later remove the cooker form the hot burner to stop cooking further. </li>
	<li>When the pressure releases naturally, open the lid.Gently fluff up with a fork.</li>
	<li>Serve chicken biryani in layers-top layer with rice and bottom layer with 
chicken.Enjoy with raita or shorba.</li>
